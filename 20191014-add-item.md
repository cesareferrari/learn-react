We have seen yesterday how to set up a basic form to collect item data that will
be sent to a remote API via a POST request so it can create a new item in a list of resources.

The form we set up was so basic that it didn't even have fields in it, just the
form skeleton and a submit button.

A proper form would have input fields so we can enter data and that's what we
are going to do now.

We need input fields for name, price, imageUrl, description, so we are just going to use input fields of type text.

Each input field will have a name, a value, a placeholder and an onChange
property.

Let me show an example first, and we'll go over the details next:

```
<input
  type="text"
  name="name"
  placeholder="Name"
  value={this.state.item.name}
  onChange={this.changeHandler}
/>
```

This is a React input component with  some props. 
The first prop is the type of input: text in our case.

We then have a name prop. This is the name of the input field and it's set to
the name of the widget we have to add.

The placeholder prop shows some placeholder text in the form field so the user
knows what data to enter.

The value prop is more interesting. Its value is set to this.state.item.name.
If you remember, we are in the ItemForm component, and this component has some
state that holds the data we need to add.

Here's how the state object looks:

```
state = {
  item: {
      name: '',
      price: '',
      imageUrl: '',
      description: '',
    }
}
```

this.state.item.name is currently set to an empty string, so the form field will
not display anything in it. It's ready to take whatever the user is going to
type in.

If you notice, the item component has an onChange prop set to a function called
changeHandler, defined in ItemForm.

Why do we need this function?

Every time the user types a letter into our input field, an onChange event is
generated. The event captures a variety of things, including the character that
was typed in.
We need to grab this character and save it into the state, along with all the
other typed characters, so we have a record of the data we need to use later on.

```
changeHandler = e => {
  let value = e.target.value;

  this.setState(prevState => ({
      item: {...prevState.item, [e.target.name]: value}
  }))
};
```
